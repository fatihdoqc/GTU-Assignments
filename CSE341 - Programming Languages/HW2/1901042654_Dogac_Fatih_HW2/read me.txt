Double values doesn't fully work.
There is no while operator because pdf didn't mention about KW_WHILE. And it was too late for me to add this feature.

For loops are not fully functional.

There is a makefile , input.txt and output.txt. 
If you like to use the terminal , just delete "<input.txt> output.txt" from makefile's last row.
